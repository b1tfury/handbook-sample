Internal communications teams typically hold off on sending a message or disseminating a document or procedure until all content has been reviewed and approved by a wide range of stakeholders. \n\nThe Handbook-first approach is very different. Ensure that changes are factually correct and improve the operation of the organization and the handbook. If there are additional changes that should accompany the submitted change, there are 2 paths forward: \n\n1.  Add those additional changes to the submitted change and approve/merge the whole thing\n2.  Create a follow-up issue to make the rest of the change and merge this one to help until that issue is worked\n\nEither way, the change gets in, the handbook gets better, the organization gets better. \n\nCreate a text file at `.gitlab/CODEOWNERS` which can be used to specify individuals to approve changes depending on where they are.  A change to how the rendering engine works or the overall template should go to someone technical and reasonably high-up. A spelling correction on a functional area page should be a low-level approval to reduce coordination cost for save changes. \n\nReplace the `@` names with individuals who fit these roles and can own the approval for changes. \n\n```\n/* @tech-guru \n/.gitlab/ @tech-guru\n/archetypes/ @design-person\n/themes/ @design-person\n/resources/ @design-person\n/content/company/ @marketing-person @executive-group\n/content/dept/peopleops/ @people-ops-person1 @people-ops-person2\n/content/dept/itops/ @itops-person1\n/content/dept/sales/ @sales-person1 @sales-person2 @sales-person3\n/content/dept/engineering/ @engineer-person1\n/content/dept/marketing/ @marketing-person\n/content/dept/finance/ @finance-person1 @finance-person2\n/content/dept/legal/ @legal-person1\n```\n\nAdd each department as they're added to the handbook.\n\nOnce `CODEOWNERS` is established, enable the code owners for Merge Request approvals.\n\n![image](/uploads/e876b6f62cbd4d52ad3431e5669141d1/image.png)","iid":2,"updated_by_id":3548980,"weight":null,"confidential":false,"due_date":null,"lock_version":1,"time_estimate":0,"relative_position":1073742823,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"last_edited_at":"2020-04-11T17:07:55.219Z","last_edited_by_id":3548980,"discussion_locked":null,"closed_at":null,"closed_by_id":null,"health_status":null,"external_key":null,"issue_type":"issue","state":"opened","events":[{"id":716609822,"project_id":17756799,"author_id":3548980,"created_at":"2020-04-11T13:39:16.271Z","updated_at":"2020-04-11T13:39:16.271Z","target_type":"Issue","group_id":null,"fingerprint":null,"action":"created"}],"timelogs":[],"notes":[{"id":322141815,"note":"changed the description","noteable_type":"Issue","author_id":3548980,"created_at":"2020-04-11T17:07:55.718Z","updated_at":"2020-04-11T17:07:55.720Z","project_id":17756799,"attachment":{"url":null},"line_code":null,"commit_id":null,"st_diff":null,"system":true,"updated_by_id":null,"position":null,"original_position":null,"resolved_at":null,"resolved_by_id":null,"discussion_id":"ee0ef9ddfc2575522d8f2759fc0e2e629711bb5d","change_position":null,"resolved_by_push":null,"confidential":null,"type":null,"author":{"name":"Mike Terhar"},"award_emoji":[],"system_note_metadata":{"id":191243272,"commit_count":null,"action":"description","created_at":"2020-04-11T17:07:55.745Z","updated_at":"2020-04-11T17:07:55.745Z"},"events":[]}],"label_links":[],"resource_label_events":[],"designs":[],"design_versions":[],"issue_assignees":[],"zoom_meetings":[],"award_emoji":[]}

Working on my fork of this repository I found out that it is enough to use extended Hugo image to prevent described failures. While it may seem to be a minor inconvenience it was a big problem for me, as I tried to generate a site (for review purposes) with automatically generated baseURL. Resources' structure is based on baseURL and it forced me to use the extended image to be able to generate it during a build.\n\nad 2. Figuring out which version of Hugo is used to build site in GitLab's pipelines took me way too much time as it was not clear where to find docker's definition.
